# Simple SDL Game Engine

## Overview

Simple SDL Game Engine is a project I worked on during my teenage years (around 16 or 17) as an attempt to create a game engine using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer). The goal was to build a low-level game engine without relying on external libraries, except for SDL.

## Project Status

Please note that this project is incomplete and was never intended for production use. It served primarily as a learning experience for me as I delved into game development and engine architecture. Due to its incomplete nature, the engine lacks many essential features and is far from being usable for any serious game development.

## Features

- **Basic User Interface**: The project includes rudimentary UI elements such as buttons, although their functionality is limited.
- **SDL Integration**: SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) is utilized as the primary graphics and input handling library for the project.

## Development Experience

Working on this project was a significant learning experience for me. As a young developer, I attempted to create a game engine from scratch, which involved understanding low-level concepts such as graphics rendering, input handling, and event loops. While the project was challenging and ultimately incomplete, it provided valuable insights into software development and game engine architecture.

## Future Plans

While this project remains incomplete and lacks many essential features, I've decided to share it as a testament to my early exploration of game development and engine creation. In the future, I may revisit this project with a more mature perspective and attempt to further develop it or apply the knowledge gained to other projects.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are not currently accepted, as it is not actively maintained. However, feel free to fork the repository and experiment with the code on your own.

## Acknowledgments

I would like to thank the developers of SDL for providing a powerful and versatile library for game development. Additionally, I am grateful for the learning opportunities this project provided me, despite its incomplete nature.
